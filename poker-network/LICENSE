             THE LICENSE OF POKER-NETWORK IS AGPLv3-or-later

This File: Canonically, this file is "LICENSE" at top level, but a copy
           is made to "COPYING" for historical reasons.

Short version: The effective license of the whole work, when copied,
               modified, conveyed, propagated and/or redistributed is
               AGPLv3-or-later, pursuant to Sections 13 of the GPLv3 and
               the AGPLv3.  More details of the licensing follows.

Details:

All code and data included in the poker-network distribution are released
under either the GNU AGPLv3-or-later, GNU GPLv3-or-later, or some more
permissive license compatible with GPLv3-or-later.

The overwhelming majority of the code is AGPLv3-or-later, because the
major authors (Loic Dachary, Johan Euphrosine, Bradley M. Kuhn, and
Mekensleep [which holds Precheur's and Pinson's copyrights]) all license
under AGPLv3-or-later.

A few others who have made minor contributions license their work under
GPLv3-or-later.  Under Section 13 of the GPLv3, the GPLv3-or-later
continues to apply to those small parts of the work that are not
copyrighted by the authors who have chosen AGPLv3-or-later.  The
"combination as such" is, therefore, is licensed under AGPLv3-or-later.
