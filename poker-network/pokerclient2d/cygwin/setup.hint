ldesc: "The client library implements the poker-network protocol for the client.
It runs a poker-engine identical to the one used by the server and uses it to simplify the implementation of a client.
For instance it creates an event indicating that the player lost position although the server does not send such a packet.
A simple minded bot is provided as an example usage of the client library."
