What is it ?

poker-network includes a poker server, a client library, an abstract
user interface library and a client based on it.

The server deals the cards and checks the user actions using a poker
game engine (poker-engine). It listens on a TCP/IP port and
understands a poker-network specific protocol. The persistent
informations (accounts, hand history etc.) are stored in a MySQL
database. The server was designed and tested to gracefully handle 1000
simultaneous players on a single machine also running the MySQL
server.

The client library implements the poker-network protocol for
the client. It runs a poker-engine identical to the one used by
the server and uses it to simplify the implementation of a client.
For instance it creates an event indicating that the player lost
position although the server does not send such a packet. A simple
minded bot is provided as an example usage of the client library.

The abstract user interface library provides a framework based on the
client library and suited to implement a user friendly client. A
display is fed with events such as give seat S to player P or get
amount A from side pot P to player P so that the rendering part of the
user interface does not need to maintain contextual game
information. A toolkit is fed with high level interaction actions such
as ask login and password or display the following holdem tables. An
animation module is fed with events that can trigger animations or
sounds such as player P timeouted or player P wins the pot.

The client based on the user interface library uses GTK.

Rationale

The decision to include a graphical client in this distribution was
made because it lacks documentation and user base. Without a proper
documention one can hardly figure out how the client libraries are
supposed to be used. And without an working client or an existing user
base one could question the usability of the server and the protocol.

======================================================================
Development status : Alpha

Features will be added
The protocol will be modified
The classes API is not stable

======================================================================
Installation

Debian GNU/Linux : use the sid package

Other GNU/Linux or Unices : 
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure 
        make ; make install

        If this is your first installation, you need to fill the
        MySQL root user name and password in ${pkgsysconfdir}/poker.server.xml.
        It will be used to create the poker database and user.

        If you already have a previous version installed, you must upgrade
        your database using:

        database/pokerdatabaseupgrade --upgrades=database conf/poker.server.xml

Others : the client part is known to work but there is no howto
