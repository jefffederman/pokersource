Subject: qpoker addition to pokersource

I'm about to commit qpoker (q like cute, like Qt) project stub to the
pokersource tree.

qpoker primary goals are:

- Display the poker table in cute (Qt) way, by extensive use of
  animation and scalable vector graphics.

- MacOSX portability (I recently bought a mac)

- Follow and ease the path of writing a new client for poker-network
  (a super awesome poker library like poker-network deserve a lot of
  clients: commandline, 2d gtk, 2d cute, 3d, web, flash ...)

- Add yours ... :)

Feel free to hug or flame.
