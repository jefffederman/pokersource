Running and debugging the server and the client from the source tree.

A test server with bots can be run as follows:

$ cd examples
$ sh run-pokerserver

You must first make sure the MySQL database administrative user
is root and no password is set. Also make sure the database
is not listening on incoming connections from the internet or
you will be in trouble. Hopefully this is the default MySQL setup
when you first install the server. The database is
wiped out each time run-pokerserver is run. The server runs on ports
19480 and above (instead of 19380 and above for an installed server
so that both a test server and an installed server can run on the
same machine).

The test-pokerweb script will launch run-pokerserver also link the
pokerweb directory to /var/www/test-poker-web (if it is not already
there). If your web server has php5, you should then be able to access
the web part of the poker server at http://localhost/test-poker-web/.
Part of the web pages will work with php4 but some require php5.

The logs of the server and the bots can be found in pokerserver.log
and pokerbot.log.

The 2D client can be run as follows:

$ cd pokerclient2d
$ GTK2_RC_FILES=data/Aero/gtkrc python poker2d poker2d-test.xml
