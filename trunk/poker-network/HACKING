Running and debugging the server and the client from the source tree.

A test server with bots can be run as follows:

$ cd examples
$ sh run-pokerserver

You will be asked for the root password of the MySQL database so that
the test database and the test user can be created. The database is
wipped out each time run-example is run. The server runs on ports
19480 and above (where the ports used for an installed server are
19380 and above).

The run-example script will also link the pokerweb directory to 
/var/www/pokerweb if it is not already there. If your web server
has php4 (or above), you should then be able to access the web part
of the poker server at http://localhost/pokerweb/.

The logs of the server and the bots can be found in pokerserver.log
and pokerbot.log.

The 2D client can be run as follows:

$ cd pokerclient2d
$ python poker2d poker2d-test.xml
