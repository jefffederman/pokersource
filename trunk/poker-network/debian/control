Description: multiplayer poker server and client library
 The server deals the cards and checks the user actions using a poker
 game engine (poker-engine). It can handle all the poker variants
 implemented by the poker game engine (holdem, omaha, omaha high/low,
 stud 7 ...) in ring games, sit and go or multitables tournaments.
 The client library can be used to implement simple clients such as
 robots (<1000 LOC example robot provided) or a graphical user
 interface.
 .
 The poker server has its own TCP/IP based protocol. The client
 library decodes the protocol. An abstract user interface library
 provides a framework to implement graphical clients.
