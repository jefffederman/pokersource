poker-network is a python poker server and client library. The server
runs the games, deals the cards and controls the game. The client
library provides a packet based API to join the ring games or
tournaments and play the most common poker variants (holdem, omaha,
7stud). A simple minded poker bot is provided as an example
application based on the client library and is used to stress test the
server.
