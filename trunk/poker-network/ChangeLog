2007-04-27  Loic Dachary  <loic@dachary.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add testclock.py and __init__.py to the
	  distribution.
	* tests/__init__.py: Needed to load the controled clock module.
	* tests/testclock.py: Controled clock for testing purposes.
	* tests/test-pokertable.py.in: new test07_break_message that covers
	  the PokerTable code related to
	  sending a message while in the BREAK_WAIT state
	* tests/test-pokerservice.py.in: Use the test clock control.
	  
	  Create a base test class (PokerServiceTestCaseBase) that setup
	  the
	  environment for pokerservices test cases.
	  
	  Change the timeout values for some tests to adapt to the
	  controled clock.
	  
	  The test06_updatePlayerRake is transformed into a standalone test
	  UpdatePlayerRakeTestCase.
	  
	  new TimerTestCase that tests pokerservice.cancelTimers method
	  new BreakTestCase that tests all pokerservice tournament breaks
	  related methods
	* tests/test-pokerclient.py.in: Move the clock control code to
	  testclock.py file.
	  
	  Adjust the timeout of some tests. This is needed because the
	  artificial clocks goes faster than the real clock. Controling the
	  clock is not an exact science because 1) threads are used for
	  pokerlock and when the threads wake up they change the number of
	  loops
	  of the twisted reactor, 2) the number of loop depends on the
	  precise
	  twisted implementation and would therefore not be exactly the
	  same
	  with twisted 1.3 or twisted 2.4. However, once the number of
	  iteration
	  has been bounded for the existing twisted implementations, there
	  is
	  very little chance that it will greatly change.
	* pokerui/pokerrenderer.py: Show PACKET_POKER_GAME_MESSAGE in the
	  same way as PACKET_POKER_MESSAGE.
	* pokernetwork/pokertable.py: Create a dedicated function for the
	  broadcasting of messages to clients. Messages
	  are of two flavors (controled by the message type argument) and
	  are only sent to
	  connected clients, chosen after the list of serials given in
	  arguments, if any.
	  
	  Use the new message broadcast function in autodealCheck.
	  
	  Modify the autodeal function to handle the case of tournament
	  breaks in a special
	  way. If autodeal is attempted while the tournament is not running
	  and that the tournament
	  is waiting for some tables to finish their hand, notify all the
	  players.
	* pokernetwork/pokerservice.py: PokerService constructor accepts a
	  string instead of a Config object. The
	  string is converted into a Config object. For testing purposes.
	  
	  cancelTimers functions that removes all timers with a name
	  containing the
	  string argument, for use by tournament break timers when shutting
	  down the
	  server.
	  
	  tourneyNewState method handles tournament break specific states
	  by calling
	  dedicated methods for each case.
	  
	  new tourneyBreakCheck method is a timer method called while the
	  tournament is on break
	  to inform the user and exit from the tournament break state.
	  
	  new tourneyDeal method that is called when a tournament switches
	  to
	  running state because in rare cases it may not receive any event
	  that
	  triggers the PokerTable autodeal function (such a case shows
	  while
	  running the tests under a controlled clock)
	  
	  new tourneyBreakWait method that broadcast informative messages
	  to the players involved
	  in the tournament, depending on their involvement in a hand.
	  
	  new tourneyBreakResume method that broadcasts a messages to all
	  players when the tournament
	  exits from the break state to go back to the running state.
	* pokernetwork/pokerpackets.py: New packet PacketPokerGameMessage
	  that is not outbound. It is used to notify the
	  client about events such as tournament breaks that are not just
	  informative but
	  connected to the game logic.
	* pokernetwork/pokerlock.py: PokerLock.acquire_sleep controls the
	  looping frequency of the thread
	  loop in case the resource is busy.
	* conf/poker.server.xml.in: breaks_check default value

2007-04-25  Loic Dachary <loic@dachary.org>

	* database/1.0.36-1.0.37.sql: Repeat field name for CHANGE COLUMNS

	* pokernetwork/pokerservice.py: Copy tournament breaks fields

	  pokerclient method setPlayerDelay.  Remove obsolete test to
	  avoid bloating. Control the twisted and poker-engine clock.
	  Reset the second counter before each test to ease the debugging
	  of time based tests. Implement a test for the pokerclient method
	  publishDelay.
	
	* pokernetwork/pokerservice.py: Replace SQL instruction related
	  to timestamp with the value from the seconds runtime.seconds
	  twisted function. This allows test cases to use a fake clock.

	* pokernetwork/{pokerclient,pokerservice,pokertable,protocol}.py:
	  replace time() with runtime.seconds so that tests can substitute

	%WWW% substitution

2006-11-30  Loic Dachary  <loic@dachary.org>

	* tests/testpoker.php.in: unit test covering 100% of pages/poker.php

	* tests/testicurrency.php.in: use root mysql user for tests

	* tests/testcurrency.php.in, pokerweb/pages/currency.php:
	_merge_notes must always be called with a string value (not numerical)
	otherwise the usage of special tables is compromized

	* tests/test-pokerservice.py.in: test setPlayerImage and getPlayerImage

	* tests/test-pokerclient.py.in: test setPlayer and getPlayer
	test cashOut (success and error)

	* tests/test-pokercashier.py.in: test cashOut failure

	* tests/test-poker-interface.py:
	define time unit in a variable and change all delays to use this time

	* pokerweb/pages/poker.php: send image_type with setPlayerImage packets

	* pokerweb/pages/edit_account.php, pokerweb/pages/create_account.php:
	add stars on mandatory fields

	* pokernetwork/server.py:
	should a deferred return on error, translate this condition into a
	PacketError that is sent to the client. It typically happens when a
	money transaction fails. If such a packet is not returned, the client
	waits forever instead of gracefully handling an error notification.

	* pokernetwork/pokerservice.py:
	getPlayerImage and setPlayerImage handle the GET_PLAYER_IMAGE and PLAYER_IMAGE
	packet types

	* pokernetwork/pokerpackets.py:
	player_image packet also carries the image mime type

	new packets: PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_IMAGE and PACKET_POKER_GET_PLAYER_IMAGE

	* pokernetwork/pokerclient.py:
	don't abort all tables if the client factory has the crashing flag set. This allows for
	running the reactor some more after catching a SIGSEGV, in order to wait for the process
	child death.

	* pokernetwork/pokercashier.py:
	Failure message now prints the content of the web page if the failure is a web "server error"
	this special case was necessary because the default str method of the web error object does not
	print the content of the page.

	cashOut special case handling fix : if cashOut all money from the safe. In this case the
	currency server is expected to return two notes : one of the total amount and the other with
	zero. The zero value note is discarded and the code gracefully behaves when there is no bank
	note going back to the safe (i.e. the user has a note and there's nothing left in the safe).

	* pokernetwork/pokeravatar.py:
	forward PACKET_POKER_GET_PLAYER_IMAGE and PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_IMAGE packet to pokerservice

	* pokernetwork/currencyclient.py:
	breakNote : if one of the two values is zero, just return the note and
	a fake zero value note (also handled in FakeCurrencyClient). Added
	FakeCurrencyClient verbosity and ability to fail on demand with
	FakeCurrencyFailure for test purposes

	* pokerclient2d/poker2d.xml.in:
	POKER_WWW_HOST replaces POKER_SERVER_HOST for the web part

	* examples/test-pokerweb:
	run-pokerserver without bots (DONT_RUN_BOTS=yes) and wait for selenium
	tests to be run manually instead of launching a curl based test suite

	* examples/run-pokerserver:
	can run the test server without bot if DONT_RUN_BOTS=yes

	* debian/rules:
	use dbconfig-common variable names instead of %SOME% in configure
	kill manual installation of pokerweb that now has its own installation

	prompt for poker-web host

	* debian/python-poker-network.postrm: dbconfig for poker database

	* debian/python-poker-network.postinst: dbconfig for poker database
	edit defaults for bots according to user answer

	mysql schema and upgrades made available to dbconfig-common

	* debian/python-poker-network.init:

	* debian/control, debian/control.breezy, debian/control.dapper, debian/control.edgy, debian/control.etch, debian/control.hoary, debian/control.sarge, debian/control.unstable:
	dbconfig depends

	* debian/changelog: fix all debian bugs

	* database/schema.sql.in:
	skin_image is a text instead of blob because it's a lot easier to handle in various languages
	upcase all SQL keywords

	* database/1.0.30-1.0.31.sql:
	skin_image is a text instead of blob because it's a lot easier to handle in various languages

	* conf/poker.bot.xml.in:

	  the players waiting for something (wait_for late, big, ). These players are marked
	  to wait_for the "first_round", i.e. will not participate to the blind/ante round.
	  This typically happens when the server sends a hand history when a arriving at 
	  a new table, because the state of the game is already past the blind/ante round
