	*  RELEASE renamed to RELEASE.old to avoid file name conflicts with some
	   build systems.

Fri Dec 10 14:16:27 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@gnu.org>

	* Release 0.126

	* include/pokereval_export.h: accomodate dynamic/static libraries

Fri Dec 03 13:31:20 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@gnu.org>

	* Release 0.125

	* config/build.m4 : removed because too complex to maintain

	* Updated Mac builds; currently, things seem to build with only
	  one config setting (--with-mac-target=darwin).
	* Make it unnecessary to have '.' in one's path when building.
	* bootstrap now checks for 'libtoolize' in both places, not 'libtool'
	  (My Debian system has no 'libtool', but my Mac does, and it's
	  not actually related to GNU libtool.)
	* boostrap now moves configure.in aside to shut up all the programs
	  that worry about configure.in's presence.
	* Fink now detected; --with-fink will default to /sw, as the
	  help claimed it did.
	* Default Mac build type is now darwin, since we have no carbon build.

	* include/enumerate.h: apply macro/comma related patch from Martin Stjernholm
	  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5586390&forum_id=40226

Sun Nov 07 13:55:00 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@gnu.org>

	* WHATS-HERE.Java: cut/paste java related stuff from WHATS-HERE

	* WHATE-HERE, README: review and update
	
	* test/digest[57].c: rewrite into enumtest[57] to get rid of md5 
	  dependency
	
	* lib/*md5*,include/md5.h: license problem and do not belong here
	
	* include/{,inlines/}*.h: add or update copyright notice at the beginning of the file.
	  Add POKEREVAL_EXPORT markers to extern symbols, include pokereval_export.h when
	  doing so. Add multiple inclusion guards when missing.
	
	* include/enumerate.h: random is called rand if WIN32 is defined

	* include/pokereval_export.h: add file to cope with
	  POKEREVAL_EXPORT keyword made to enable the use of poker-eval as
	  a shared library on windows.

	* include/Makefile.am (nobase_pkginclude_HEADERS): pokereval_export.h

	* lib/mktable.c: %xLL is %xi64 if WIN32 is defined

Sun Nov 07 11:42:07 2004  Loic Dachary  <loic@gnu.org>

	* tests/run.in : tests from Makefile.in are now in a script. Accomodate for
	  md5sum change in calling syntax

	* configure.ac: detect awk / md5sum
	
	* configure.ac/Makefile.am: java is not included in the distribution until
	  licensing issues are solved.
	
	* include/deck_std.h (StdDeck_CardMask_OP): missing backslash at end of line

	* config/ccache.m4, config/build.m4: macros for configure.ac

	* configure.ac: modern configure for autoconf2.5, do not override configure.in that
	  is still the default for older configures

	* include/poker_config.h.in: obsoletes include/config.h.in to avoid name conflicts
	  when distributing the headers. include/config.h is still being used for inclusions
	  within the poker-eval sources but is not published.

	* bootstrap: script to re-generate autotools files

	* poker-eval.pc.in: add pkg-config declaration file

	* AUTHORS: add missing list of authors

	* NEWS: RELEASE is now NEWS (standard file) but RELEASE is kept back

	* {include,tests,lib,examples}/Makefile.am : automake compatibility
