INCORRECT BEHAVIOR
------------------
Lowball evaluation in eval_low.h is broken for certain 6- and 7-card hands, 
such as full house plus pair, and quads plus trips.

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------
Joker decks and Asian stud decks are not supported in pokenum, thanks to
inconvenient design of the deck and card mask types.  These types and
their accompanying macros and functions need a reorganization.

NICE TO HAVE
------------
The macro DECK_ENUMERATE_PERMUTATIONS_D visits each ordered set of *ordered*
subsets.  That is, it visits all of
  {{Ac,Ks}, {4d,2h}}
  {{Ac,Ks}, {2h,4d}}
  {{Ks,Ac}, {4d,2h}}
  {{Ks,Ac}, {2h,4d}}
This isn't needed for the kinds of enumerations we do in pokenum, which
doesn't care about the order of each player's cards.  This means that pokenum
redundantly visits matchups multiple times in stud and draw games (but still
gets the right EV answers).

There is no makedepend support, so make doesn't know to recompile a file when
an include file changes.  And there are lots of includes!

The autoconf/configure tool is not being used to create the shared libraries
in a platform-independent way.  The current configure.in hard-codes the
commands to build *.a, *.so, and *.dll.  Building *.a works on any unix
system, but building the *.so now only works with gcc.
