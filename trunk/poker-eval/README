This is the README file for the pokersource poker hand evaluator
library.  The library may be obtained from the pokersource web site,
www.pokersource.org.  


To learn more about the features of the library, and how to get
started using it, see the WHATS-HERE file in the root directory of the
library distribution.  


The PokerSource evaluator library is free software and is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License.


In order to compile the Java portions of the package, you will need the
following packages.  You can simply download the jar file for each and add
them to your CLASSPATH:
    Apache Oro regular expressions (org.apache.oro.*) [tested with v2.0.6]
        http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/
    JUnit test framework (junit.framework.*) [tested with v3.7]
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/
If you aren't interested in the Java portions, you can compile the C
library on its own.  The Java code is documented in the java/javadoc/
directory.

Compiling -- Unix systems:

This library uses the GNU Autoconf self-configuration mechanism, so
compiling on a Unix system should be fairly simple.  Just enter the
following commands: 
  ./configure
  make 
  make test

The "make test" command will run several test programs to ensure that
everything works correctly.  On slow machines, the tests may take
several minutes.  (Note: The make files may have some dependencies on GNU
make; if this is the case, they may need to be edited before the
library and test programs will compile properly.)  


Compiling -- Windows, using cygwin: 

If you have the cygwin package installed, you can build the library as
per the directions above for Unix systems.  (You may need to create a
link for /bin (some versions of cygwin don't do this properly on
installation) so that the configure script can find /bin/sh and other
required files.)  


Compiling -- DOS / Windows: 

The library can also be compiled using Microsoft Visual C++.  In each
directory, special DOS makefiles are provided, called makefile.dos.
To compile the library, make sure that the VC tools are on the path
and that the LIB variable is properly set (VC provides a batch file,
vcvars32.bat, to set this up), and enter the following commands:
  cd lib
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\examples
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\tests
  nmake -f makefile.dos

You can't use make to run the test programs under Windows as you can
on Unix, but you can run them (digtest5 and digtest7, in the tests
directory) and compare the output value with the value in the make
file (makefile.dos in the tests directory) to ensure that the right
thing happened.  

Once the library is built, you can use the resulting library
(libpoker.lib) in other Visual C++ projects.  Make sure to put the
include directory of the pokersource library package in the include
path for projects that will be using the library.  



Reporting bugs, suggesting improvements: 

As of August 1999, the pokersource evaluator library is maintained by
