Hi Folks,

Here are the poker routines I wrote with the help of Keith Miyake and
Roy T.  Hashimoto.  If you can figure out how to use them, enjoy.  If
not, perhaps you can ask me, or try to get some info from someone else
on rec.gambling.

Also included is a rewrite of Roy Hashimoto's fish program, which evaluates
all possible hands given some initial starting conditions.

If you want to add to these, or write some documentation, let me know
and I'll try to make sure you don't step on anyone else's toes.  I
don't know if I'll ever do anything with these routines, but it was fun
to write them.

Since their initial creation, I have spruced the code up after receiving
pointers from Keith and Roy and I have recoded Roy's fish program to use
rank_eval.  I've also split the source into a few appropriate directories
and made the helper routines and the lookup tables into a library, so
programs that don't need particular routines or tables aren't saddled with
too much extra baggage.

Please let me know if you find a bug.  So far these routines have run
successfully on a SPARC, a variety of HP machines, a '486, a DEC Alpha
and an mc68040.
