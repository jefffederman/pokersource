Hi Folks,

Here are the poker routines I wrote with the help of Keith Miyake
(kmiyake@cs.rutgers.edu), Roy T.  Hashimoto (hashimoto@sgi.com) and Mat
Hostetter (mat@ardi.com).  If you can figure out how to use them, enjoy.
If not, perhaps you can ask me, or try to get some info from someone
else on rec.gambling.

NOTE:   To use these routines with any compiler other than gcc will
	require you to modify them to not use gcc extensions.  To do
	so you'll need to understand the gcc extensions which we use,
	which means you probably have access to gcc in the first place,
	hence if you don't have gcc, you probably can't use these
	routines at all.

The "eval7" code is all due to Mat Hostetter's influence.  It was he who
pointed out that there was a lot of information to be had for free once
you or in all the elements of each suit.  He wrote the files
make_switch.c, make_switch.h and switch_preamble.c.  I modified the rest
of my code to use Mat's new algorithm and wrote the file tree.h and
tree_inlines.h with guidance from Mat.

Also included is a rewrite of Roy's fish program, which evaluates all
possible hands given some initial starting conditions.

If you want to add to these, or write some documentation, let me know
and I'll try to make sure you don't step on anyone else's toes.  I don't
know if I'll ever do anything with these routines, but it was fun
writing them.

Please let me know if you find a bug.  So far these routines have run
successfully on a SPARC, a variety of HP machines, a '486, a DEC Alpha,
a mc68040 and a MIPS.
