libtinypoker
------------

*libtinypoker* provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to applications
implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) Version 2.0. The library
provides a robust communications framework that allows clients and servers
to communicate over secure transport layer sockets (TLS) using Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and/or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
The underlying code is designed to gracefully handle network problems
such as unexpected disconnections and bad input. IPP message validation,
normalization and parsing functions are available to developers as are
several predefined types for representing poker games, players and cards.
