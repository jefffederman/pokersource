Gna!
----

https://gna.org/[Gna!], a central point for development, distribution 
and maintenance of Libre Software (Free Software) projects, hosts the 
subversion repository that is used for '{siteTitle}' development.

PokerSource
-----------

The http://pokersource.info/[PokerSource] project maintains the largest 
repository of quality poker-related Free Software. Without PokerSource 
and the excellent software the project produces, like 
http://pokersource.info/poker-eval.php[poker-eval], '{siteTitle}'
would not exist. The project also deserves a lot of thanks for giving me 
access to the subversion repository.

Loic Dachary
------------

Loic has inspired me (Thomas Cort) to continue to develop and enhance
'{siteTitle}'. Without Loic, I would have never resumed development of 
'{siteTitle}' and I probably would have abandoned it after it served its 
purpose in the programming competition.
