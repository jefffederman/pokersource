Thank you for stopping by and checking out '{siteTitle}'.
'{siteTitle}' is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
The '{siteTitle}' project was founded in 2005 to create a poker server
and poker bot programming framework. It has evolved since then and is
currently undergoing a major re-write. The new library, *libtinypoker*,
is close to being ready for its first release. The new server,
*tinypokerd*, needs additional game logic. The target release dates
are April 1, 2008 for *libtinypoker* and July 1, 2008 for *tinypokerd*.
