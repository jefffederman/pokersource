Thank you for stopping by and checking out '{siteTitle}'.
'{siteTitle}' is a collection of http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software]
for poker and is written and maintained by http://www.tomcort.com/[Thomas Cort]. 
The '{siteTitle}' project was founded in 2005 to create a poker server
and poker bot programming framework. It has evolved since then and is
currently undergoing a major re-write. The new library, *libtinypoker*,
just had its first release. The new server, *tinypokerd*, needs
additional game logic. The target release date for *tinypokerd*
is July 1, 2008.

.Features
- Secure client/server communications with Transport Layer Security.
- Support for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and version 6 (IPv6).
- User authentication with Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).
- Compatible with existing Internet Poker Protocol 2.0 Implementations.

April 1, 2008 - libtinypoker 0.0.0 Released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first release of *libtinypoker* is now available
in the http://tinypoker.org/download.html[downloads] section.
*libtinypoker* provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to applications
implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) Version 2.0. The library
provides a robust communications framework that allows clients and servers
to communicate over secure transport layer sockets (TLS) using Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and/or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
The underlying code is designed to gracefully handle network problems
such as unexpected disconnections and bad input. IPP message validation,
normalization and parsing functions are available to developers as are
several predefined types for representing poker games, players and cards.
