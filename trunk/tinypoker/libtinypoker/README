To simplify the network code, speed up the message parser, increase
security and provide a more robust input validator, TinyPoker will be
implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) Version 2.0
See: http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ferguson/poker/ipp.html

This library, libtinypoker, will implement both the client and
server networking code and protocol functionality. Game logic
and program configuration will remain outside the library.

Goals
=====

 - Fully implement the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) Version 2.0.
 - Provide the ability to normalize and validate messages.
 - Gracefully handle network problems (bad input, disconnections, etc).
 - Provide a secure communications channel between the client and server.
