libtinypoker provides application programming interfaces
(APIs) to applications implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP)
Version 2.0. The library provides a robust communications framework
that allows clients and servers to communicate over secure transport
layer sockets (TLS). The underlying code is designed to gracefully
handle network problems such as unexpected disconnections and bad
input. IPP message validation, normalization and parsing functions
are available to developers as are several predefined types for
representing poker games, players and cards.
