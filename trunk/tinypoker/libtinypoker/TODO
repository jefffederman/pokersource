 * portability improvements
  - port to wine
    + use select() instead of pthreads to do recv/send timeouts
    + find regex replacement... some possibilities listed below
      ~ look for public domain RE lib
      ~ look for non-POSIX free software RE lib
      ~ implement a subset of pcre
      ~ scrap regular expressions and use a custom validator
      ~ use regex on POSIX systems and custom validator on other systems
    + update unit tests to execute under wine
      ~ need to add a check in CMakeLists.txt for wine binary
  - test on one or more of OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD
 * doxygen support for build system
 * do version checks for libs in build system (lib >= major.minor.patch)
 * need to check for gcrypt.h and libgcrypt in build system
 * improve code comments
 * man pages
 * programming guide
 * stud and draw
