1.0 USER GUIDE

The following command will start a server which hosts poker games on
port 9999: 

./pokerd

Below is a list of command line options that will modify the operation
of the server. Usage is identical to assignment specification.

Command Line Options
--------------------
--debug                 || -d            = run in foreground
--log                   || -l            = log using syslog
--port (port)           || -p (port)     = tcp port
--configfile (filename) || -c (filename) = configuration
--help                  || -h            = display help message
--dbusername (username)                  = username for db server
--dbpassword (password)                  = password for db server
--dbhostname (hostname)                  = hostname for db server
--dbdatabase (database)                  = database for db server

2.0 Build Instructions

To compile this program you need the following libraries installed:
	pthread, pq, z, crypt, nsl, m, poker-eval, gsl, gslcblas, ssl

The libraries should be provided by the following packages or the
following package's dependencies:
	OpenSSL                (openssl.org) (BSD-style License)
	GNU Scientific Library (gnu.org/software/gsl)  (GNU GPL)
	poker-eval             (pokersource.sf.net)    (GNU GPL)
	MySQL                  (mysql.org)             (GNU GPL)

To compile this program you need the following tools installed:
	make, gcc, bison, flex

Make Options
------------
make [all]            Build all
make warn             Include Warnings
make optimize         Enable optimizations and nothing else
make debug            Include Debugging Info and Warnings
make help             Display this help

You'll need to setup the database prior to running the server. You can
do this by executing the following command from the pokerd src directory:
	psql pokerd pokerd < pokerd.sql
After you execute the SQL you will have two player accounts, player1 and
player2 with the password 'secret'. You will probably want to add 
player accounts. Currently there is no tool to do this. For now add them
with the following SQL query: 
	INSERT INTO users (username,passwd) VALUES ('username',md5('passwd'));

4.0 Program Overview

Configuration

There are a number of ways to configure the server. First, you can change
the system defaults in the conf.c file. Second, you can use command line
switches (see above). Third, you can create a configuration file called
".pokerd". That file contains a set of keys and values. The possible
keys are: dbusername, dbpassword, dbhostname, dbdatabase, 
port, debug, log. An example configuration lines is "port=9999".

How it works

The execution begins in main.c All of the internal structures are
initialized and things get configured. After that control moves to 
pokerserv.c This part of the code handles incoming connections. A
new thread is created that runs the actual games (deals, etc) and the
main thread creates a socket and waits for activity. Once a new player
connects a thread is created to authenticate that player. Once 
the player is authenticated the authentication thread dies at the
end of auth.c. The thread handling the game play will know about
the new player the next time it looks at the 'users' database table.
The users' socket descriptor is stored there. When there are 0 or 1
players the server does a loop in poker.c where it checks the database
for new users and then sleeps. Once there are enough users to play
a game (2) the game begins. If there are >10 players only 10 get dealt
in. The rest of the players just get to view the action. Stats are kept
in the database to ensure that everyone gets a chance to play. When
a signal is recieved a flag is set and the threads exit as soon as
possible. There is a counter in monitor.c that ensures all of the
threads are dead before the server exits.

Using the Program

Using the server is pretty simple. You just type ./pokerd and it goes.
If you want to see what it is doing use the -d switch to stop it
from going into the background. You can also look at the database tables
to see how well or how poorly players are doing.

To stop the program just send it a QUIT signal. kill -3 [pid_of_pokerd]
You can also type ctrl+c if pokerd is in interactive mode (ie pokerd -d)

There isn't much in the way of client software at the moment. You can
download a simple text based client for testing out the
server software at the following URL: http://tomcort.com/poker 
The contribution of a graphical client would be rewarded with beer. 
E-mail code@member.fsf.org if you've got one.

5.0 Testing Comments

Very little testing has been done, so please use this code at your
own risk. From what I can tell using a memory profiling program called
valgrind there aren't any memory leaks. The server also doesn't randomly
lock up or crash during normal operation. However, I haven't purposely
given it a lot of bad input.

I have created a simple text based client and it seems to work rather 
well for testing things. The code is on here tomcort.com/poker. Please 
test this program. If you find a problem try to isolate it and
then send me a bug report (code@member.fsf.org). Accepted patches will 
be rewarded with beer at the Lion in Lennoxville, Quebec.

6.0 Known Bugs

There are no known bugs to note at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.0 Near Future Improvements

Use libdaemon to replace sig.c, time.c, log.c, and daemon.c.
Use libconfuse to replace conf.c, config.l, config.y

Include PHP code for a stats web page
More Logging/Stats (log every action, log hole cards, etc)
Man Pages
Autotool (./configure scripts)
Player management tool (add / remove players)

7.1 Far Future Improvements

Multiple concurrent games (tables)
Other poker variants (no limit, 5 card draw, 7 card stud, etc)
Log Analysis (player modelling)

Overall code cleanup - a lot of the code in poker.c deals with clients 
that disconnect or fail to respond. I'd like to come up with a cleaner 
solution. Any ideas?
