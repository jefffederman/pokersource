Compiling from source
=====================

You need the following to build the binary...

	cmake	http://cmake.org
	make	http://www.gnu.org/software/make
	gcc	http://gcc.gnu.org

There isn't a configuration file reader/parser (yet), so you have to 
edit main.c and hard code your username and password (eek!). This should 
be fixed soon.

Configure, compile, install...

	$ cmake .
	$ make
	# make install
