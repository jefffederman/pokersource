Below are some notes to anyone considering hacking around with the code...

GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.0 should be followed as closely as
possible. See http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/
Note, I haven't finished reading it myself, so there may be a few things
that need to be changed.

i18n is important. Always use _("foobar") for strings that get displayed
to users.

See the 'TODO' file for some pending/outstanding tasks.
