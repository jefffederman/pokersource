 * GUI Stuff

	- create a dialog/windows/wizard for configuring the network 
	info, username and password.

	directory, get some translations and setup the build
	system to do some magic at compile time and install
	the translation files.

 * Graphics

	- create some SVG images of playing cards.

	- create a splash screen wxSplash

 * Sound

	- record/create sound effects (chip clicks, card shuffles, etc)
