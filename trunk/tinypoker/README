TinyPoker is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
Originally the code was written for a poker bot programming competition 
for the Computer Science Club[1] at Bishop's University[2] in 
Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada. The project has been dormant for the past 
couple of years, but development has resumed.

pokerd - a Texas Hold'em poker server designed primarily for poker 
bots. It handles one 10 player table/game at a time. If more than 10 
players are connected, players are rotated in and out based on how 
many hands they've played recently. The server stores game results in a
MySQL database. It is ideal for small programming competitions and 
simulations.

cbot, cppbot, jbot - basic networking code written in C, C++, and Java. 
It will allow you connect to a server and send/recv commands. If you are 
having a bot programming competition with participants who don't know 
much about network programming, you can give them this so that they 
don't get bogged down with the network communications part of the 
project and can focus on the AI.

bagelbot - a basic bot designed for use with pokerd. This bot connects 
to the server, joins the game, and folds every chance it gets. It is
intended to be used as an example for creating a new bots. You just have 
to add the programming logic to determine to fold, raise, bet, or call.
