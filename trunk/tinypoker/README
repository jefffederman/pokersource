TinyPoker is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
Originally the code was written for a poker bot programming competition 
for the Computer Science Club at Bishop's University in 
Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada. The project has been dormant for the past 
couple of years, but development has resumed.
