TinyPoker is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
Originally the code was written for a poker bot programming competition 
for the Computer Science Club at Bishop's University in Lennoxville, 
Quebec, Canada. It has evolved since then and is currently undergoing a 
major re-write. 

libtinypoker - provides application programming interfaces
(APIs) to applications implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP)
Version 2.0. IPP message validation, normalization and parsing functions
are available to developers as are several predefined types for
representing poker games, players and cards.
 
tinypokerd - the TinyPoker server. It will use libtinypoker to
implement the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) 2.0. The code will
be based on the pokerd code base and experience implementing pokerd. An
effort will be made to make the server footprint even smaller than 
pokerd.

tinypokerclient - a basic GUI designed for use with tinypokerd. The primary
purpose is to provide a way for humans to more easily debug poker bots and
tinypokerd.

tinypokerbot - a basic bot designed for use with tinypokerd. This bot 
connects to the server, joins the game, and folds every chance it gets. It is
intended to be used as an example for creating a new bots. You just have 
to add the programming logic to determine to fold, raise, bet, or call.
