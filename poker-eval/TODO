Lowball evaluation in eval_low.h is broken for certain 6- and 7-card hands, 
such as full house plus pair, and quads plus trips.

Joker decks and Asian stud decks are not supported in pokenum, thanks to
inconvenient design of the deck and card mask types.  These types and
their accompanying macros and functions need a reorganization.

There is no makedepend support, so make doesn't know to recompile a file when
an include file changes.  And there are lots of includes!
