Introduction
============

This is the README file for the pokersource poker hand evaluator
library.  The library may be obtained from the pokersource web site,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pokersource/

To learn more about the features of the library, and how to get
started using it, see the WHATS-HERE file in the root directory of the
library distribution.  

The PokerSource evaluator library is Free Software and is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the COPYING file
in the root directory of the distribution.

Compiling -- GNU/Linux and Unix systems
=========================
This library uses the GNU Autoconf self-configuration mechanism, so
compiling on a GNU/Linux and Unix system should be fairly simple.  

To build both the C library and the examples:
  ./configure
  make 

To build and run the tests:

  ./configure
  make test

The "make test" command will run several test programs to ensure that
everything works correctly.  On slow machines, the tests may take
several minutes.

To install the library and the headers (by default they will
install in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/poker-eval 
respectively):

   ./configure
   make install

To run the examples:

   cd examples
   read the usage at the beginning of the source file
   and run the program accordingly

Compiling -- Windows, using cygwin 
==================================
If you have the cygwin package installed, you can build the library as
per the directions above for GNU/Linux and Unix systems.

Compiling -- DOS / Windows (May be obsolete, please send updates
to cpinson@freesheep.org)
================================================================
The library can also be compiled using Microsoft Visual C++.  In each
directory, special DOS makefiles are provided, called makefile.dos.
To compile the library, make sure that the VC tools are on the path
and that the LIB variable is properly set (VC provides a batch file,
vcvars32.bat, to set this up), and enter the following commands:
  cd lib
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\examples
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\tests
  nmake -f makefile.dos

The Java layer is not supported yet on Windows.

You can't use make to run the test programs under Windows as you can
on Unix, but you can run them (digtest5 and digtest7, in the tests
directory) and compare the output value with the value in the make
file (makefile.dos in the tests directory) to ensure that the right
thing happened.  

Once the library is built, you can use the resulting library
(libpoker.lib) in other Visual C++ projects.  Make sure to put the
include directory of the pokersource library package in the include
path for projects that will be using the library.  

Reporting bugs, suggesting improvements
=======================================
As of November 2004, the poker-eval library is maintained by
Brian Goetz.  Bug reports, suggestions for improvements, or candidates
for inclusion should be sent to
     Loic Dachary <loic@gnu.org>
     Tim Showalter <tjs@psaux.com> 
     Michael Maurer <mjmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>
