Hi Folks,

Here are the poker routines I wrote in the course of two nights.  If
you can figure out how to use them, enjoy.  If not, perhaps you can ask
me, or try to get some info from someone else on rec.gambling.

If you want to add to these, or write some documentation, let me know
and I'll try to make sure you don't step on anyone else's toes.  I
don't know if I'll ever do anything with these routines, but it was fun
to write them.

Please let me know if you find a bug.  So far these routines have run
successfully on a SPARC, a variety of HP machines, a '486, a DEC Alpha
and an mc68040.
