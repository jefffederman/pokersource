TinyPoker is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
Originally the code was written for a poker bot programming competition 
for the Computer Science Club at Bishop's University in 
Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada. It has evolved since then and is currently
undergoing a major re-write. 

libtinypoker - libtinypoker provides application programming interfaces
(APIs) to applications implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP)
Version 2.0. The library provides a robust communications framework
that allows clients and servers to communicate over secure transport
layer sockets (TLS) using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and/or
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). The underlying code is designed
to gracefully handle network problems such as unexpected disconnections
and bad input. IPP message validation, normalization and parsing
functions are available to developers as are several predefined types
for representing poker games, players and cards.
 
tinypokerd - Internet Poker Protocol (IPP) version 2.0 Server.

tinypokerclient - a basic GUI designed for use with tinypokerd. The primary
purpose is to provide a way for humans to more easily debug poker bots and
tinypokerd.

bagelbot-ng - a basic bot designed for use with tinypokerd. This bot connects 
to the server, joins the game, and folds every chance it gets. It is
intended to be used as an example for creating a new bots. You just have 
to add the programming logic to determine to fold, raise, bet, or call.
