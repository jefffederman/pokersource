 * portability improvements
  - port to wine
    + use select() to handle timeouts
    + implement win32 api version of connect/servloop
    + need to add a check in CMakeLists.txt for wine binary
  - test on one or more of OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD
 * doxygen support for build system
 * need to check for gcrypt.h and libgcrypt in build system
 * man pages
 * programming guide
 * stud and draw
 * unit tests for network code
 * error reporting system - currently there is no way to tell the program using libtinypoker 
	about some syscall failures... dns lookup failures, malloc failures, etc
