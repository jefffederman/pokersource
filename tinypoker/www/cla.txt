Contributor License Agreements
==============================

Before contributions to TinyPoker can be accepted into the official 
distribution, contributors must complete a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement[Contributor License Agreement]
(CLA). The CLA makes clear who the contributor is, the 
source of the contribution, whether the contributor is allowed to make 
the contribution or not, and it also grants a copyright license and 
patent license to Thomas Cort to protect him and the users of TinyPoker.
The agreement will also make license enforcement easier.
