Thank you for stopping by and checking out '{siteTitle}'.
'{siteTitle}' is a collection of poker software written by Thomas Cort. 
Originally, the code was written for a poker bot programming competition 
for the http://cs.ubishops.ca/[Computer Science]
http://j9.ubishops.ca/[Club] at http://www.ubishops.ca/[Bishop's University]
in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennoxville,_Quebec[Lennoxville, Quebec],
http://www.canada.gc.ca/[Canada] that was held in the fall of 2005. '{siteTitle}'
development was mostly dormant from then until some time in 2007.

When development resumed in 2007, the author decided to change the underlying
protocol from one that was used by the University of Alberta to the
Internet Poker Protocol (IPP), refine the server, develop a complete
client/server library, reduce the server footprint, and add additional security
features such as TLS encryption. These enhancements are still in progress.
