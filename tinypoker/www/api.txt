libtinypoker application programming interface
==============================================

*libtinypoker* provides application programming interfaces
(APIs) to applications implementing the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP)
Version 2.0. The library provides a robust communications framework
that allows clients and servers to communicate over secure transport
layer sockets (TLS) using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and/or
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). The underlying code is designed
to gracefully handle network problems such as unexpected disconnections
and bad input. IPP message validation, normalization and parsing
functions are available to developers as are several predefined types
for representing poker games, players and cards.

This document will descibe how to use *libtinypoker* in your applications.
The document also covers installing the library itself.

Install the Dependencies
------------------------

*libtinypoker* has just one dependency, http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/[GNU TLS].

Obtain the Source Code
----------------------

The next step is to get a copy of the *libtinypoker* source code.
This can be done by checking out a fresh copy from the http://subversion.tigris.org/[subversion]
http://tinypoker.org/subversion.html[repository] or by
http://tinypoker.org/download.html[downloading] the latest release.

Build and Install libtinypoker
------------------------------

.Configure, make and install
--------------------------------------
 $ cmake .
 $ make
 # make install
--------------------------------------

Generate X.509 Certificates
---------------------------

*libtinypoker* uses TLS to secure client/server communications.
This is not a standard part of the Internet Poker Protocol, but
it adds a layer of security that preventing players from snooping
on each other with packet sniffers. See http://tinypoker.org/server.html[server setup]
for instructions on setting up a proxy server with stunnel that will allow
unmodified legacy clients to connect.

For *libtinypoker* to work, it needs a server side certificate. You can
obtain a certificate from a trusted certificate authority or you can create your own
certificate authority and sign your own certificates. The example below
demonstrates how to create your own certificate authority and sign your
own certificates using the *certtool* program that comes with
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/[GNU TLS].

.ca.tmpl
--------------------------------
cn = Dummy Certificate Authority
ca
cert_signing_key
--------------------------------

.localhost.tmpl
---------------------------------
organization = Dummy Organization
cn = localhost
tls_www_server
encryption_key
signing_key
dns_name = localhost
---------------------------------

------------------------------------------
 $ certtool --generate-privkey > ca-key.pem
 $ certtool --generate-privkey > key.pem
 $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
       --template ca.tmpl --outfile ca.pem
 $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate ca.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
       --template localhost.tmpl --outfile cert.pem
------------------------------------------

Library Initialization and Destruction
--------------------------------------

Several GNU TLS resources need to be allocated before network
communications begin and deallocated after network connications
end. Two functions are provided to accomplish this, *ipp_init()*
and *ipp_exit()*. The one and only header file needed to use the
API is *tinypoker.h*.

.test.c
------------------------------------------
#include <tinypoker.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	ipp_init();

	ipp_exit();
	return 0;
}
------------------------------------------

Compilation
-----------

Compiling a *libtinypoker* application is relatively simple.
One simply needs to instruct the compiler to link against the
library and GNU TLS.

------------------------------------------
 $ gcc -lpthread -ltinypoker -lgnutls -o test test.c
------------------------------------------

To be continued
---------------

This document is being written as *tinypokerclient* and *bagelbot-ng* are
being developed, so it is still very much a work in progress. If you want
to go further, take a look at *tinypoker.h*; it is well commented and
should give you and idea about the functions and structures available.
