	* Release 1.0.9

	* pokerengine/pokergame.py (PokerGame.buildPlayerList): exclude players with
	  wait_for = "first_round". This is only meaningful when set before starting

	  allowing it to join the game after the next game.

	  "first_round". It may be used to exclude players from the blind/ante round and

	 case can happen indeed although very rarely.
